### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page


Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- SASS

### What I learned

This was my first time using a mobile-first approach in a large project like this one.
So i hope to use this more in my future projects.

I also saw it as a challenge to change the hover state of the svg image links in the footer.
But i found a way out through that.

### Continued development

The Hero image isn't perfect on the destop view, so this is something i would like to perfect.
